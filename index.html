                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> On the distant planet of Kaichi, live a species not too dissimilar from humans but with powers beyond the wildest imaginations of earthlings. A land with people of four different nations scattered across it; fire, earth, air and water. Each of the nations have the power to control one of the elements and use it with all their might.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> Every year, each of the nations would put their best bender forward to see who would become the oracle for the generation. The oracle would protect Kaichi and also ensure that peace was maintained between the four nations. Kura Okami was born in the house of a fisherman and his water-bending wife. Nothing much was expected of young Kura except when he showed exceptional potential in the art of bending as a child.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> It was only natural that the water nation saw Kura Okami as the chosen one that would lead their nation to glory and prosperity by becoming the oracle of his time. As a teenager, Kura was allowed to be as mischievous as he wished and he would regularly put on shows of water-bending tricks for everyone in the village to see. When the time had come, the entire village unanimously decided to send Kura to Mount Jiro for the trials to become the oracle.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> At Mount Jiro, myriads of people from across the four nations assembled to watch the four greatest benders battle it out for greatness. Up against the young water-bender Kura was a 50 year old fire-bender known for his wrath and great power. The earth nation had sent forth a lady that could create literal mountains out of just mounds of sand. The air nation nominated whom they considered their greatest bender, a child half as old as Kura himself.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> The games began with great fervour to the sounds of cheers and applause. The fire nation's bender began by showing a "dragon flame", a trick that had not been witnessed since several centuries and received thundering applause. The earth nation's bender tried to build a large star but the power was too much to bear for her and she succumbed to death. Kura displayed a water world masterpiece when it was his turn and people were too spellbound to even clap for him. At that moment, the child from the air nation tried to sabotage Kura and his water world.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> Kura knew exactly what he was trying to do and he sent rays of water upon the child which he successfully deflected towards the audience. A lot of panic was caused and people began to run like wild horses to save their lives. Kura began to create new spells in his mind that he knew nobody had ever seen before and that the air-bender would have no defense for.</p>
                                
                                    <p style="color:#d3d3d3; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;text-shadow: 0 0 3px #000, 5px 5px 5px #000;"> The air-bender surprised him by attacking Kura first and sent him flying lengths away. Kura sent a large trident wave at the air-bender and he tried all his might to repel it but it was too much for him. He exploded from all the pressure the water was putting at him and Kura reigned the victorious oracle. The people that were still around applauded him and presented the holy pendant to him, thus solidifying his status.</p>
